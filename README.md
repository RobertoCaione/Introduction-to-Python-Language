# Introduction-to-Python-Language
An instrument for those who wants to learn Python language, from undergraduate students to high school professors to company employees. 
Python is the programming language of the day and thanks to its versatility is used in a lot of work and study fields. Using the very comfortable and innovative Jupyter Notebook I wrote some documents where Â the basic theory is exposed.
